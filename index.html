    of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with his children sharing their father's dislike of apartheid.His maternal
    grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking
    journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk

  <h2>Business career</h2>
<h3>Zip2</h3>
<p>
    In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.
    The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.
    They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto, Musk coding the website every night.Eventually, Zip2 obtained
    contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon
    a merger with CitySearch; however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307
    million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.

<h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
<p>
    Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company. X.com was one of the
    first federally insured online banks, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation. Even
    though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill
    Harris by the end of the year.

    In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition, as Confinity's money-transfer service PayPal
    was more popular than X.com's service. Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft
    over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and led Peter Thiel, Confinity's founder, to
    resign. With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model,
    the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000. Under Thiel, the company focused on the
    money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in
    stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million. In 2017, more than 15
    years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its sentimental value.In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of
    creating "X, the everything app".

<h3>Tesla</h3>
<p>
    Tesla—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A
    round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk
    led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder,
    and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster
    product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.Following a series of escalating
    conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership
    of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a
    Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any
    automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his
    position as CEO.Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles,
    it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla began delivery of its
    four-door Model S sedan in 2012.A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015. A mass-market sedan, the Model 3,
    was released in 2017.The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it
    became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally. A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched
    in 2020.The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed
    multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.

    Since its initial public offering in 2010,Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker
    in summer 2020, and it entered the S&P 500 later that year. In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of
    $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.In November 2021, Musk proposed, on Twitter, to sell 10% of
    his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance".After more than 3.5
    million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,and a total of
    $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon
    and Kimbal Musk were under investigation by the SEC for possible insider trading related to the sale.In 2022, Musk
    unveiled a robot developed by Tesla, Optimus.
